This is a straightforward monthly budget tracking app made in Android using the Android SDK. It has functionalities for setting various recurring monthly expenses, such as rent, power, utilities, food, etc. In addition to being able to set monthly expenses, it also allows you to enter in your monthly income. After doing so, the app will calculate your total budget for the current month, which will be displayed on the main page. You can also click on the "Add" button to move to a new page, which has an interactable calendar, where clicking on a particular date will open up a dialog allowing you to either add an additional expense, income, or deadline for that particular date. If you're adding an additional expense, you can place place the new expense event under a category of your choosing (which you can create or delete as you wish). After adding either an income or expense event, you can view it in the grid formatted list below the calendar, which displays columns organized by each category. Clicking on a particular event within the list will open a dialog where the user can edit, or delete events. As for deadlines, users can specify a specific hour and minute in addition to the date. When the deadline's time passes, a notification containing the deadline's amount, and description will be sent to the user's device reminding the user of the deadline. Similar to expenses and income events added through the calendar, the user can bring up their list of deadlines by clicking on the "Deadlines" button, which will display a list of current upcoming deadlines. Clicking on a particular deadline within this list will open a dialog enabling edits, or deletion of the deadline. Finally, the app also has a receipt scannnig feature, accessed through the "Scan Receipt" button on the main page. It allows users to take pictures of a receipt, where an OCR algorithm will then extract text from the image, and ideally be able to extract the total amount from a given receipt image. It isn't perfect, which is why the app asks the user for confirmation of the total amount. After the user confirms the amount, the app will automatically create an expense event on the current date, which can be viewed in the grid list discussed previously.

See the video below for a basic demonstration of the app.
